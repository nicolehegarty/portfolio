					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
						Creative Undergraduate currently completing final year at Ulster University studying BSc (Hons) Music, Sound and Technology; actively seeking a short-term opportunity to gain experience and develop a professional network within the Music Industry. I am a determined individual with a willingness to learn, and a key understanding of the important role communication has in a team.
					</p>
					<p>
						My ambition is a career in designing and engineering sound,  I have a strong interest in live sound engineering and stage-work, most recently I have worked voluntarily at the L≈´minƒÅre Festival with Music Capital. I'm also interested in visual arts, event planning, radio and media production. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Through my degree, I have enjoyed learning and participating in activities relating to room acoustics, sound engineering, creative coding and interactive systems. I am a team player and have demonstrated my ability to be a leader through being a Course Representative. As a Music, Sound and Technology student I am also a member of the MST Society, I have participated in improving the society and assisted in creating and managing a small-scale concert with the society and local artists.
